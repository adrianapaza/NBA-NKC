An experiment will to have a front end and a back end.

"We placed no limits on how many shapes could be toggled on or off in each trial. A participant could change none, some, or all attributes in a trial. The soft- ware also displayed all previously tried combinations and their respective payoffs to support decision making."

"After making a choice, subjects were informed about the payoff of the selected combination, thereby completing a trial"
